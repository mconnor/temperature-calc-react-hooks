# React Hooks/Typescript Demo

This simple  project was bootstrapped with [Create React App and type-script][crap-typescript] like so...

```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript```

Use this project as a template  [React-Hooks][hooks] and typescript projects.

Hooks simplifies state management - replacing class components for functional component.  Fewer cleaner lines of code. And type-script is super awesome in catching errors before the creep into your code base.
